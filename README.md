# Integration
This calculates integration using is the useful Trapezoidal Rule and the Simpson Rules. With the Trapezoidal rule, the area under a curve is evaluated by dividing the total area into subtrapezoids rather than rectangles. Simpson's Rule is based on the idea that given three points, we could find the equation of a quadratic through the given points.
