# Integration
This calculates integration using the useful Trapezoidal rule and the Simpson's rule. With the Trapezoidal rule, the area under the curve is evaluated by dividing the total area into subtrapezoids rather than rectangles. Simpson's rule is based on the idea that given three points, we could find the quadradtic equation through the given points.
